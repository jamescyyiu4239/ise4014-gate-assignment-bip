-------------------------------------------------
The program is written in Python, with the aid of the following libraries:

NumPy, pandas, argparse, PuLP

-------------------------------------------------
There is one script in the folder (gate.py).

-------------------------------------------------
There is four required CSV files for importing as the data files.

1) passenger_flow.csv

2) baggage_flow.csv

3) distance_matrix_pax.csv

4) distance_matrix_bag.csv

OR for including passengers for arrival, these four would be used instead.

1) passenger_flow_w_arr.csv

2) baggage_flow_w_arr.csv

3) distance_matrix_pax_w_arr.csv

4) distance_matrix_bag_w_arr.csv

-------------------------------------------------
Regarding the usage of the Python script, you may have a look at the below:

gate.py

It is used for assigning gates to the arrival flights.

It have to be called via command line with the arguments.

-------------------------------------------------
Should you have any questions regarding to the script, feel free to contact me by any means.
